# Applied Software Development Course Outcomes - Svelte PWA

A live version of this project can be accessed [here](https://outcomes.newlands.dev).

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev),  created using a project template available at: https://github.com/tretapey/svelte-pwa. 

The project is quite simple in that it displays a list of learning outcomes that can then be filtered by year, type and module. The next steps include adding a way to quickly add notes/ideas under each outcome to replace my current spreadsheet approach.

The primary purpose of creating this project was to try and understand the hype surrounding the Svelte framework and take a look at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for web hosting.
